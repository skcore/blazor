# Blazor application simple html input controls events 
The Blazor sample Web client application created in Dotnet 8 is used to demonstrate input control events. Onclick and OnChange events for buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select have been implemented.

**Bevents** page for the onclick events for the button

**Cevents** page for the onchange events for the checkbox

**Revents** page for the onchange events for the radio button

**Tevents** page for the onchange events for the textbox

**Sevents** page for the onchange events for the select

>Additionally, datetime was included to text controls using formatted values and culture-specific values.

**Note: This is just an example application free of build issues.**
